# Privacy Policy for AutoTok

_Last updated: November 13, 2025_

This Privacy Policy explains how AutoTok ("the Application") handles data when interacting with TikTok’s API.

## 1. General Information
AutoTok is a private application designed for personal use by its developer or authorized users only.  
The Application does **not** collect, store, or share personal information with third parties.

## 2. Data Collected
AutoTok may process limited technical information necessary for its operation, including:
- Temporary TikTok access tokens (for API authentication)
- Metadata related to uploaded videos (title, caption, etc.)

No personal or sensitive data is stored beyond the active session.  
AutoTok does not use cookies, analytics, or any tracking technologies.

## 3. Use of TikTok API
AutoTok interacts with TikTok strictly under TikTok’s Developer Terms of Service.  
All data access is authorized by the user and limited to the permissions granted by TikTok’s OAuth system.

## 4. Data Retention
All access tokens and upload-related information are temporary and automatically discarded after use.  
AutoTok does not maintain any persistent database or logs containing user data.

## 5. Security
Reasonable technical measures are used to protect API keys and tokens from unauthorized access.  
However, as the Application is private and locally operated, the user is responsible for secure handling of credentials.

## 6. Third-Party Sharing
AutoTok does not share, sell, or disclose any data to third parties.

## 7. Changes to This Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically.  
The “Last updated” date at the top will indicate when the latest version was published.
